# Description

I was using [three-line-2d](https://github.com/mattdesl/three-line-2d) but ran into problems when
updating three.js beyond revision 0.127. That project looks fairly dead (at the time of writing,
it hasn't been updated for over 5 years). Therefore, I copied the following files into
this project and made the necessary adjustments to get it working on the latest version of three.js.
